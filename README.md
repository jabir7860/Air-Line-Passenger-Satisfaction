# Air-Line-Passenger-Satisfaction

How Passengers feel in Airport ? 
About Infrastructure,check in check out etc.., data set. 
Outcome : Already have sarvey data(reviews given past passengers) we can predict Binary Classification Satisfaction.
Problem Type : Super Vised Machine Learning Problem - Classification Type. 
Data Source : Train & Test Data Available. Link : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/teejmahal20/airline-passenger-satisfaction.
Data Format : 


Model : Model Interpretability,Time Complexity.
Implementation : 
1) Read Data.
2) Data Processing. 
3) Data Visualization. -->Plot Variables
4) Data Preparation -->Necessary Steps Before Modelling
5) Modelling --> Try Different Machine Learing Models

Data Format : 
Whatinformation do we getfrom this data?
The datasets contains 23 different attributes which are -
1. Gender: Gender of the passengers
Male : Male Passenger
Female : Female Passenger
2. Customer Type: The customer type as per loyality and behaviour

In Range etc.., like 23 types

Evaluation Criteria : 
If we can reach up to 95% accuracy at predicting whether or not a customer is satisfaction with the airline services,
then only we'll pursue for further application purpose.
